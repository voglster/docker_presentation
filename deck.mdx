# Docker
a practical react developer guide

by Jim Vogel


---

```
Docker is a game changer,
at first its some black box,
the second it clicks for you,
you will never look at development the same
```

-- My UI/UX/react Developer

---

## Quick overview

- what docker is
- how to use docker
- demo of docker in the real world
- quick touch on kubernetes
- Q&A
- ...
- profit?

---

## What is docker?

```
super lightweight VM
wrapped networking
wrapped filesystem
fast turn on/off/reset
```

---

## Great so what do we use it for?

    need a service?
    - mongodb
    - redis?
    - insert service name here

You don't have to learn how to install them, <br/>configure them, <br/>or worry about dependencies

No management of the services, just develop the application

---


## Hey wait what about deployment

- build once
- deploy anywhere (mostly)


---


# Assuming you have:
- control over a dns name
- a pc in the cloud (digital ocean droplet?)
- a little knowledge about docker
- a "dockerized" app

You can deploy that app with ssl in a few minutes for the public to see


---

# where do you get docker?
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Hello world for docker
```
docker run --rm hello-world
```

---

# Command Line vs GUI

There are gui tools

you wont see them here

opinionated comment:

## command line is better


---

# How Do I's of Docker

 - starting containers
 - port forwarding
 - seeing whats running
 - mounting data
 - logging and output
 - getting "inside" a running container


---

# Port Forwarding

docker abstracts and isolates networks for you

you need to explicitly expose ports

`docker run -p 8006:80 nginx`

---


# Persistent Storage

docker abstracts and isolates storage for you

if you want date to stay you need to mount a drive

`docker run -v /opt/data:/data nginx`


---

# Let's see what's running

`docker ps -a`

 - ps command shows running processes
 - -a is for all

---

# Let's see some logs

tail and follow are your best friends

`docker logs --tail=50 -f mongo1`

---

# Getting IN the container

<img style={{width:"30%", height: "30%"}} src={i}/>

caveat, you only need this when really in the weeds

`docker exec -it mongo1 bash`


---

# Talking between containers

 - abstracted and isolated networks
 - manual creation

practical perspective:

Use docker-compose

---

# Alright what is docker compose

multiple related services, one command

driven off a yaml config file:

`docker-compose.yml`

---

# example:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo

  api:
    image: pyapp
    environment:
      - DB_HOST:mongo
    ports:
      - 8005:8005
```

config is passed via environment variables

[click me](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) for env documentation example

# Demo of docker compose and app interaction

---

# Kubernetes

way too big to intro with this meetup

- even higher level abstraction than docker/compose
- way more yaml
- describe services, fail overs etc
- make a zero downtime application (even through deployments)

---

# Example Kubernetes YAML

```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # Type of the kubernetes resource
metadata:
  name: auth # Name of the Kubernetes resource
spec:
  revisionHistoryLimit: 0
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: auth
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: auth
          image: bestbuy_auth:kube
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - name: auth-port
              containerPort: 8000
          env:
            - name: MOUNT_POINT
              value: service/auth
```
